# simpledit

This project is a lightweight JavaScript-based molecular editor. It was created because only a few JS-based molecular editors are currently available. The current version is a pre-alpha prototype with a very minimal user interface.

Avogadro2 and the [rowan](https://labs.rowansci.com/editor) are excellent alternatives. However, this project was initiated as a foundation for future work and experimentation.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [usage.md](./usage.md) file.

## Future Directions

- LLM integration  
- Command-line and in-editor console support  
- rdkit-js integration for 2D editing and broader file format support  
- UI refinements  
- ASE integration for in-editor calculations using diverse packages and calculators
